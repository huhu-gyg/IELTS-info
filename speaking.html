                <p><strong>The speaking test is a face-to-face interview between the test taker and an examiner.</strong></p>

                <p>The speaking test contains three sections.</p>
                <p>Section 1: introduction and interview (4–5 minutes). Test takers may be asked about their home, family, work, studies, hobbies, interests, 
                reasons for taking IELTS exam as well as other general topics such as clothing, free time, computers and the internet.</p>
                <p>Section 2: long turn (3–4 minutes). Test takers are given a task card about a particular topic. 
                Test takers have one minute to prepare to talk about this topic. The task card states the points that should be included in the talk and one aspect 
                of the topic which must be explained during the talk. Test takers are then expected to talk about the topic for 2 minutes, 
                after which the examiner may ask one or two questions.</p>
                <p>Section 3: discussions (4–5 minutes). The third section involves a discussion between the examiner and the test taker, 
                generally on questions relating to the theme which they have already spoken about in Section 2.</p>
                
                <h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
                <p><strong>Make the most of your Speaking test:</strong><br>
                - try to talk as much as you can<br>
                - talk as fluently as possible and be spontaneous<br>
                - relax, be confident and enjoy using your English<br>
                - develop your answers<br>
                - speak more than the examiner<br>
                - ask for clarification if necessary<br>
                - do not learn prepared answers; the examiner is trained to spot this and will change the question<br>
                - express your opinions; you will be assessed on your ability to communicate<br>
                - the examiner’s questions tend to be fairly predictable; practise at home and record yourself<br></p>
