                <h3 id="write">Writing test structure</h3>
                <p><strong>The Writing paper has two tasks which must both be completed.</strong>
                In task 1 test takers write at least 150 words in about 20 minutes. In task 2 test takers write at least 250 words in about 40 minutes. 
                Test takers will be penalised if their answer is too short or does not relate to the topic. Answers should be written in full sentences (test takers must not use notes or bullet points).</p>

                <h4>IELTS Academic</h4>
                <p>Task 1: test takers describe a graph, table, chart or diagram in their own words.</p>
                <p>Task 2: test takers discuss a point of view, argument or problem. Depending on the task, test takers may be required to present a solution to a problem, 
                present and justify an opinion, compare and contrast evidence, opinions and implications, and evaluate and challenge ideas, evidence or an argument.</p>

                <h4>IELTS General Training</h4>
                <p>Task 1: test takers write a letter in response to a given everyday situation. For example, writing to an accommodation officer about problems with your accommodation, 
                writing to a new employer about problems managing your time, writing to a local newspaper about a plan to develop a local airport.</p>
                <p>Task 2: test takers write an essay about a topic of general interests. For example, whether smoking should be banned in public places, 
                whether children’s leisure activities should be educational, how environmental problems can be solved.</p>
                
                <h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
                <p><strong>Make the most of your Writing test:</strong><br>

                - analyse each task properly and spend some time making notes<br>
                - highlight or underline key words in the tasks to make sure that you focus on what you have to do<br>
                - plan your answers<br>
                - use paragraphs clearly; put one idea in each paragraph<br>
                - do not repeat ideas using different words<br>
                - do not copy whole sentences from the question – you will receive no marks for this<br>
                - keep to the topic; do not write about unrelated subjects<br>
                - manage your time; remember, Task 2 is worth twice as much as Task 1<br>
                - spend approximately 20 minutes on Task 1 and approximately 40 minutes on Task 2<br>
                - pay attention to the number of words required for each task; you will lose marks if you do not write at least 150 words for Task 1 and at least 250 words for Task 2<br>
                - learn to recognise how long 150 and 250 words look in your handwriting; you will not have time to count during the test<br>
                - you must write your answers in full; answers written in note form or in bullet points will lose marks<br>
                - pay attention to spelling, grammar and punctuation; you will lose marks for mistakes<br>
                - avoid informal language<br>
                - do not memorise model answers; examiners are trained to recognise them and your test will be invalid<br>
                - spend several minutes re-reading and correcting your answers<br></p>
