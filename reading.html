                <p><strong>The Reading paper has three sections and texts totaling 2,150-2,750 words.</strong>
                There will be a variety of question types, such as multiple choice, short-answer questions, identifying information, identifying writer’s views, 
                labeling diagrams, completing a summary using words taken from the text and matching information/headings/features in the text/sentence endings. 
                Test takers should be careful when writing down their answers as they will lose marks for incorrect spelling and grammar.</p>

                <h4>Texts in IELTS Academic</h4>
                <p>Three reading texts, which come from books, journals, magazines, newspapers and online resources written for non-specialist audiences.</p>
                <p>All the topics are of general interest to students at undergraduate or postgraduate level.</p>

                <h4>Texts in IELTS General Training</h4>
                <p>Section 1 contains two or three short texts or several shorter texts, which deal with everyday topics. For example, timetables or notices – 
                things a person would need to understand when living in an English-speaking country.</p>
                <p>Section 2 contains two texts, which deal with work. For example, job descriptions, contracts, training materials.</p>
                <p>Section 3 contains one long text about a topic of general interest. The text is generally descriptive, longer and more complex than the texts in Sections 1 and 2. The text will be taken from a newspaper, magazine, book or online resource.</p>

                <h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
                <p><strong>Make the most of your Reading test:</strong><br>
                    - look out for the title, headings and any special features such as capital letters, underlining, italics, figures, graphs and tables<br>
                    - make sure that you understand the questions and follow instructions carefully<br>
                    - pay attention to timing; do not spend too long on one passage or question<br>
                    - do not try and read every word; remember, you are reading for a purpose<br>
                    - if you do not know the answer to a question, attempt it but do not waste time; move quickly onto the next one<br>
                    - do not panic if you do not know anything about the subject of the text; all the answers can be found in the text<br>
                    - the word(s) you use must be taken from the Reading text; you must not change the form of the word(s) in the text<br>
                    - do not worry if there is a word that you do not understand – you may not need to use it<br>
                    - check your spelling<br>
                    - be careful to use singular and plural correctly<br>
                    - focus precisely on what you are asked to do in ‘completion’ type questions<br>
                    - if the question asks you to complete the note ‘in the…’ and the correct answer is ‘evening’, just use ‘evening’ as your answer; note that ‘in the evening’ would be incorrect<br>
                    - pay attention to the word limit; for example, if you are asked to complete a sentence using no more than two words, if the correct answer is ‘silk shirt’, the answer ‘shirt made of silk’ would be incorrect<br>
                    - attempt all questions; there are no penalties for incorrect answers, so you have nothing to lose<br>
                    - check your answers<br></p>
