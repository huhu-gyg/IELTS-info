                <p><strong>The module comprises four sections,</strong> with ten questions in each section. It takes 40 minutes: 30 - for testing, plus 10 for transferring the answers to an answer sheet.</p> 
                <p>Sections 1 and 2 are about everyday, social situations.<br>
                - Section 1 has a conversation between two speakers (for example, a conversation about travel arrangements)<br>
                - Section 2 has one person speaking (for example, a speech about local facilities).</p>
                <p>Sections 3 and 4 are about educational and training situations<br>
                - Section 3 is a conversation between two main speakers (for example, a discussion between two university students, perhaps guided by a tutor)<br>
                - Section 4 has one person speaking about an academic subject.</p>
                <p>Each section begins with a short introduction telling the test taker about the situation and the speakers. Then they have some time to look through the questions. The questions are in the same order as the information in the recording, so the answer to the first question will be before the answer to the second question, and so on. The first three sections have a break in the middle allowing test takers to look at the remaining questions. Each section is heard only once.</p>
                <p>At the end of the test students are given 10 minutes to transfer their answers to an answer sheet. Test takers will lose marks for incorrect spelling and grammar.</p>

                <h3 id="tips">Tips</h3>
                <p><strong>Make the most of your Listening test:</strong><br>
                - if you cannot hear the audio clearly, let a member of staff know straightaway<br>
                - follow the instructions carefully; they may be different to practice or previous tests<br>
                - listen for the specific information you want<br>
                - try and anticipate what the speaker will say; this will require concentration<br>
                - do not worry if there is a word you do not understand; you may not need to use it<br>
                - if you do not know the answer to a question, attempt it but do not waste time; move quickly onto the next one<br>
                - be careful with your spelling and grammar<br>
                - do not panic if you think the topic is too difficult or the speaker is too fast; relax and tune in<br>
                - read, write and listen at the same time<br>
                - focus precisely on what you are asked to do in completion type questions<br>
                - pay attention to the word limit; for example, if you are asked to complete a sentence using no more than two words, if the correct answer is ‘leather coat’, the answer ‘coat made of leather’ would be incorrect<br>
                - if the question asks you to complete the note ‘in the…’ and the correct answer is ‘morning’, note that ‘in the morning’ would be incorrect; the correct answer is 'morning'<br>
                - attempt all questions; there are no penalties for incorrect answers<br>
                - check your answers<br>
